Radar Tracking of Quality Toolkit (RadTraQ)
============================================
RadTraQ is a python library housing routines related to assessing and monitoring the quality of a radar's quality and calibration. This library is a work in progress, currently housing scipts to plot radar CFADs, plot and analyze corner reflector scans, calculate noise floors, create cloud masks, and plot up average profiles for comparisons.


Check out the `documentation <https://arm-development.github.io/RadTraQ/build/html/index.html>`_ and `example gallery <https://arm-development.github.io/RadTraQ/build/html/source/auto_examples/index.html>`_ for more details.

Papers that these routines are based on will be listed in the documentation for each relevant function.
