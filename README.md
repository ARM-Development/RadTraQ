Radar Tracking of Quality Toolkit (RadTraQ)
============================================

![](https://github.com/ARM-Development/RadTraQ/workflows/RadTRAQ/badge.svg)

RadTraQ is a python library housing routines related to assessing and monitoring the quality of a radar's quality and calibration. This library is a work in progress, currently housing scipts to plot radar CFADs, plot and analyze corner reflector scans, calculate noise floors, create cloud masks, and plot up average profiles for comparisons.
